KBC
For creating a KBC game in Python, here’s a basic structure you can use:

### 1. Question Structure
- **Questions**: Each question should have four answer options (A, B, C, D).
- **Levels**: Questions can be divided into levels of difficulty—easy, medium, hard.

### 2. Winning Amounts
Here's a breakdown of the winning amounts you could assign per question:

| Question Number | Winning Amount |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 1               | 1,000          |
| 2               | 2,000          |
| 3               | 3,000          |
| 4               | 5,000          |
| 5               | 10,000         |
| 6               | 20,000         |
| 7               | 40,000         |
| 8               | 80,000         |
| 9               | 1,60,000       |
| 10              | 3,20,000       |
| 11              | 6,40,000       |
| 12              | 12,50,000      |
| 13              | 25,00,000      |
| 14              | 50,00,000      |
| 15              | 1 Crore        |

### 3. Lifelines
Include lifelines like:
- **50:50** (removes two incorrect answers)
- **Audience Poll** (simulated percentages for each option)
- **Phone a Friend** (provides a hint)

### 4. Game Flow
1. Display each question and answer options.
2. Get the user’s answer and check if it's correct.
3. Update the prize amount based on the correct answer.
4. Offer lifelines at certain levels.
