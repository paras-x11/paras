# 18. What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. 

-> Tuple: A tuple is an immutable data structure in Python that stores a collection of items. 

-> Key Characteristics:
    - Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation (no adding, removing, or modifying elements).
    - Ordered: Maintains the order of elements.
    - Heterogeneous: Can contain different data types.
    - Syntax: Defined using parentheses `()`.

-> Example:   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a')

-> Differences Between List and Tuple:

| Feature           | List                            | Tuple                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Syntax            | `[]` (square brackets)          | `()` (parentheses)              |
| Mutability        | Mutable                         | Immutable                       |
| Methods           | More methods (e.g., `append()`) | Fewer methods (e.g., `count()`) |
| Performance       | Slower                          | Faster                          |
| Use Cases         | Flexible collections            | Fixed collections               |

-> Summary:
    - Use lists for collections that may change.
    - Use tuples for fixed collections of items.
