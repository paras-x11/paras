5. What is the purpose continue statement in python? 

-> The continue statement in Python is used in loops to skip the current iteration and move directly to the next one. 
   When encountered, it ignores the remaining code in the loop for that iteration.

-> Key Points:
    - Purpose: To skip specific iterations based on a condition.
    - Usage: Typically used inside for or while loops.

Example:

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue  # Skip when i is 2
    print(i)

Output:
0
1
3
4
In this example, the number 2 is skipped in the output because of the continue statement.
