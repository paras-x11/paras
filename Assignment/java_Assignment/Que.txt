-->> OOPS : 

• Create a class to print the area of a square and a rectangle. The class has two methods 
with the same name but different number of parameters. The method for printing 
area of a rectangle has two parameters which are length and breadth respectively 
while the other method for printing area of square has one parameter which is side 
of square. 

• Create a class with a method that prints "This is a parent class" and its subclass with 
another method that prints "This is child class". Now, create an object for each of 
the class and call 1 - method of parent class by object of parent class 2 - method of 
child class by object of child class 3 - method of parent class by object of child class 

• Create a class named 'Member' having the following members: 
1. Data members 
2. Name 
3. Age 
4. Phone number 
5. Address 
6. Salary 
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members. 
 
• Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members 'length' and 'breadth' and 
two methods to print the area and perimeter of the rectangle respectively. Its 
constructor having parameters for length and breadth is used to initialize the length 
and breadth of the rectangle. Let class 'Square' inherit the 'Rectangle' class with its 
constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s) calling the constructor of its 
parent class as 'super (s, s)'. Print the area and perimeter of a rectangle and a square. 

• Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 
5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor. 

• Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class 
named 'Complex' with separate methods for each operation whose real and 
imaginary parts are entered by user. 

• Create an abstract class 'Parent' with a method 'message'. It has two subclasses each 
having a method with the same name 'message' that prints "This is first subclass" 
and "This is second subclass" respectively. Call the methods 'message' by creating 
an object for each subclass. 

• Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. $100, $150 and 
$200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC'are 
subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named 'getBalance'. Call this 
method by creating an object of each of the three classes. 

• We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 
100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an 
abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two 
other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the 
percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three 
subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student 
B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for 
both the students. 

• Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 
'Factorial'. Factorial of any number n is represented by n! And is equal to 1*2*3*. 
*(n-1) *n.E.g.- 
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24 
3! = 3*2*1 = 6       2! = 2*1 = 2 Also, 1! = 1        0! = 0 

• We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract 
class 'Shape' with three abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea' taking two 
parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. The 
parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its 
side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing 
all the three methods 'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the 
area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of class 'Area' and 
call all the three methods. 
 
• Write a program which will ask the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). Define a 
method that will display grades according to the marks entered as below: 
Marks Grade : 
1-100 A 
1-90 B 
1-80 B 
1-70 C 
1-60 D 
41-50 DD40   Fail 

• Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is this is shape". Then 
create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape class, both 
having a method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular shape" 
respectively. Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print 
"Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the 
object of 'Square' class. 


-->>String: 

• Write a Java program to count the letters, spaces, numbers and other characters of 
an input string. 

• Write a Java program to print the ASCII value of a given character. 

• Write a Java program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of 
n+nn+nnn. Input number: 5 
5 + 55 + 555

• W.A.J.P to get the character at the given index within the String. Original String = 
Tops Technologies! The character at position 0 is T, The character at position 10 is

topsint.com and topsint.com: true Comparing Topsint.com and topsint.com: false 

• W.A.J.P to check whether a given string ends with the contents of another string. 
"Java Exercises" ends with "se"? False "Java Exercise" ends with "se"? True 

• W.A.J.P to check whether a given string starts with the contents of another string. 
Red is favorite color. Starts with Red? True Orange is also my favorite color. Starts 
with Red? False I3.

• W.A.J.P to find the second most frequent character in a given string. The given string 
is: successes The second most frequent char in the string is: c 

• Create a class named 'Print Number' to print various numbers of different data types 
by creating different methods with the same name 'printn' having a parameter for 
each data type. 

• Create a class to print an integer and a character with two methods having 
the same name but different sequence of the integer and the character 
parameters. For example, if the parameters of the first method are of the form (int n, char c), then 
that of the second method will be of the form (char c, int n).
