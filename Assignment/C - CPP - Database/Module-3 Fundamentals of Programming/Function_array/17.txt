17. WAP to show difference between Structure and Union.  


-> Structure (struct):

    - Memory Allocation:

        Allocates memory for all members.
        Size is the sum of the sizes of all members plus any padding for alignment.

    - Access:

        All members can be accessed independently and simultaneously.
        Each member has its own unique memory address.

    - Use Case:

        Suitable for storing multiple pieces of related data.
        Example: Representing a person with name, age, address.

    - Syntax:

        struct Person {
            char name[50];
            int age;
        };


-> Union (union):

    - Memory Allocation:

        Allocates memory for the largest member only.
        Size is determined by the size of the largest member.

    - Access:

        Only one member can be used at a time.
        All members share the same memory location.

    - Use Case:

        Suitable for saving memory when different types are used exclusively.
        Example: Handling different data types in a variant type.


    - Syntax:

        union Variant {
            int intValue;
            float floatValue;
            char stringValue[20];
        };
