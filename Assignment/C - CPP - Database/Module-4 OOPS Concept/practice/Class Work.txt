1. 
Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store.
An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables‐a part number(type String),a part
description(type String),a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item  (double). Your
class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for
each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named getInvoice Amount that calculates the invoice
amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the
quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0. Write a
test application named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoice’s capabilities.

2.
Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as instance variables—a first name
(typeString), a last name (typeString) and a monthly salary (double). Your class should have a constructor that
initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly
salary is not positive, set it to 0.0. Write a test application named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class
Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each
Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again..
