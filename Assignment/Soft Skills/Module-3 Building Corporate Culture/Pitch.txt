Computer Application from Veer Narmad South Gujarat University. I’m passionate about leveraging technology 
to solve real-world problems and am eager to begin my journey in the IT industry."

"During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in programming languages like C, C++, and Python, along 
with skills in web development and database management. I also worked on an exciting project called eZcart, 
an online shopping web app. Beyond programming, I have a keen interest in exploring new tech trends, which 
helps me stay creative and sharp. My primary focus is on software development and web technologies."

theoretical knowledge into practical solutions."
