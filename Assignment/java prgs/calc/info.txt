calc is a package.
packages works only on class files. if in calc folder(package) .java file is not available it will still work with class files
in other folders like 'java prgs' -> UsingPackage.java



if i want to run prg in this calc folder :
javac -d . *.java    then,
java calc/'fileName' -> java calc/Sum
